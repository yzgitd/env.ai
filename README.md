Python Version: py3.7

It comes in 3 versions:

1. Perform client interactive intelligent classification based on torch load model and PYQt5

2. Intelligent real-time classification via camera based on Yolov5

3. 3D intelligent instant recognition based on Mediapipe

If you need to know the details of model training, you can ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/JayITH/JayITH/issues).
